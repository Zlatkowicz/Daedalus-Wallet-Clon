                        Nikola Glumac has been working with web technologies since 2007. He discovered his love for web development during his studies at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at University of Zagreb, Croatia, where he earned his Master of Engineering degree in Mechatronics and Robotics. As a part of his master’s degree thesis he developed a Javascript WebGL-based web application for marking and analyzing medieval books and manuscripts. This application was used as a primary research tool by a PhD candidate for her thesis at Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at University of Zagreb. Today his main focus lies on latest web technologies and Javascript frameworks, and development of responsive and reactive cross-platform applications.
